> **TODO**

- [ ] Scale it up ⬆️ by using the entire content of papers (instead of just abstracts)
- [ ] Aggregate KG results into a graph database as a single large Knowledge Graph (e.g. Neo4J ... etc)
- [ ] Pre-process nodes by applying entity and relationship resolution techniques to identify and merge semantically similar nodes and relationships (maybe!?)
- [ ] Expand the approach to other types of data and texts (not limited to scientific literature)
